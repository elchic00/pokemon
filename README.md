Pokemon Python by Andrew Alagna:

I implemented classes for pokemon, players (cpu and human), grid squares, and the grid.
I created functions to generate a random pokemon, traverse the grid, throw pokeballs at wild pokemon, to battle, to use a potion, to collect the starting player info, to choose a starting pokemon, and a function called playing_game which will continue to traverse the grid until you have no more pokemon or capture 4.
