## Pokemon Python by Andrew Alagna:

#### I implemented classes for pokemon, players (cpu and human with helper functions), grid squares, and the grid.

#### I created functions to generate a random pokemon,traverse the grid, throw pokeballs at wild pokemon, to battle, use a potion, collect the starting player info, to choose a starting pokemon, and a function called playing_game which will continue to traverse the grid until you have no more pokemon or capture 4.

ðŸš· = cant access grid-square

ðŸŒ´ = a generic area you can walk on 

ðŸ¦” = a wild pokemon

â›” = a pokeball you can pick up (white ball in gif)

ðŸ¥Š = a cpu ready to fight

ðŸ«¡ = where the current player is located (salute face)

âœ… = visited grid-sqaure
