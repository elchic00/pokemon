Pokemon Python by Andrew Alagna:

I implemented classes for pokemon, players (cpu and human), grid squares, and the grid.
I also created a class to generate random pokemon, to traverse the grid, to throw pokeballs at wild pokemon, to battle, to collect the starting player info, to choose a starting pokemon, and one last function called playing_game which will continue to traverse the grid until either you have no more pokemon left or win 4.
