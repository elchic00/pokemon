## Pokemon Python by Andrew Alagna:

#### I implemented classes for pokemon, players (cpu and human), grid squares, and the grid.

#### I created functions to generate a random pokemon, traverse the grid, throw pokeballs at wild pokemon, to battle, to use a potion, to collect the starting player info, to choose a starting pokemon, and a function called playing_game which will continue to traverse the grid until you have no more pokemon or capture 4.

🚷 = cant access grid-square

🌴 = a generic area you can walk on 

🦔 = a wild pokemon

⛔ = a pokeball you can pick up (white ball in gif)

🥊 = a cpu ready to fight

🫡 = where the current player is located

✅ = already visited grid-sqaure
